# Sparta Blog

This ReadME explains the use of Rub on Rails to support table association followed with form validation. This task waas found to be very difficult and I would have to say that I found it a little tricky to comprehend. The task relied on the creation of a Blog website from wich there where three tables all related to one and another. The User, Blog and Comments. 

### Languages used
* Ruby...on rails
* Postgres
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap)

### How to download
1. Search for Adnaan-m in GitHub. [Click Here](https://github.com/Adnaan-m/sparta_blog) for the link.
2. Search for the Sparta_Blog repository.
3. Download the files displayed.

### Challenges
1. The main issue with this task was the conceptualisation of the syntax to link the tables together. As it was the first time doing this process, it was difficult to find the right file path syntax to link and display the correct information required. An example would be displayig all the blogs a User makes and the comments that link to that certain blog. 
2. Although the the previous task was complete, it was then difficult to display the information aesthetically. The best way I conceptualised this information was through a table where one column consisted of the blogs and the second column consisted of the comments within the blog. The error that I came across was that all the comments from all the blogs placed themselves with the bottom blog causing an inaccurate link.  

### Learning points
I would definitely say that table association is one of the most tricky aspects of Ruby and requires alot of conceptual throughts to relay the pathway of information to seed through.
